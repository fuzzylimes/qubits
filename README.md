# QuBits - A no frills QR Code generator
Simple app for generating QR Codes.

Allows you to generate QR Codes for:
* URLs
* Text strings
* SMS Templates
* Email Templates
* VCards
* WiFi networks

> VCards are kind of jank. As I learned from this project, no one seems to follow the standards. As such, I generate a v3 VCard that is mostly correct, but appears to be read by both ios and android __mostly__ fine. There's still some values that refuse to be read. I've wasted too much time on VCard's alone, can't be bothered to invest more time.

## Motivation
Wanted to do a project to learn about QR codes, and this is what came out. I know there are already many tools out there that do the same/similar things. This one aims to be nothing special, aside easy, quick, and free.
